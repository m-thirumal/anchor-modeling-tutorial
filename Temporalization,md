# Temporalization

Temporalization in Anchor Modeling is the process of making data time-aware — meaning, every piece of information (attribute or tie) can have a valid time range.

This allows to:

* Track historical changes.
* Know what was true at any point in time.
* Avoid overwriting old data.

Think of it as versioning built into your data model, without losing normalization or creating redundant tables.

| **Temporalization**           | Making attributes or ties **time-aware** by storing **valid-from / valid-to**                                   |
| **Benefits**                  | History tracking, auditability, reconstructing past states                                                      |
| **Anchor Modeling Principle** | All attributes and ties can be temporal; anchors themselves are generally non-temporal (identity never changes) |

## Unary Temporalization (Single Temporal Dependency)

Only the attribute itself is temporalized.

Its value changes independently of other attributes.

There is no dependency on other attributes’ validity periods.

## Binary Temporalization (Dual Temporal Dependency)

One attribute depends on the temporal validity of another attribute (usually a key or foreign reference).

The validity of one attribute is tied to the other’s valid period.

## Concurrent Reliance Temporalization (Multiple Dependent Attributes)

Multiple attributes are dependent on each other’s temporal validity, forming a group of co-temporal attributes.

All attributes in the group share the same valid-from / valid-to period.

Changes to any attribute in the group trigger a new record for all attributes simultaneously.

| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Unary**               | Independent                          |  Changes independently                         |
| **Binary**              | Depends on one other temporal entity  | Attribute validity tied to tie/anchor         |
| **Concurrent Reliance** | Depends on multiple attributes      | Attributes must always be consistent together |
